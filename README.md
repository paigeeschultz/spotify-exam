# In this repository, we analyize 3 of Miley Cyrus' albums- Plastic Hearts, Younger Now, and The Time of Our Lives. We include a word cloud of the most used lyrics for each album. From these wordclouds it might appear that "The Time of Our Lives" album has more of a positive sentiment than th eother 2 albums, but through our sentiment analysis we can see that it actually has the most negative words out of the 3 followed by "Plastic Hearts" and then "Younger Now". In this repository, we also compared each albums net sentiment with popularity and duration. Finally, we compared each albums popularity over time with respect to release date.
