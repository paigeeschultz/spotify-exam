Midnight and the moon is out
Careful, you might hurt yourself
Pleasure leads to pain
To me, they're both the same
Sweat drippin' down to the floor
Bite marks like an animal
You might be insane
But maybe we're the same
Tonight you came here
'Cause you know what I need
And no one likes to be alone
I don't need a future, I don't need your past
I just need a lover
So gimme what I want or I'll give it to my-
Self-inflicted torture, you don't have to ask
I just need a lover
So gimme what I want or I'll give it to myself
I can tell that you're new to this
Slow it down, but you can't resist
Beat your fantasy
Give yourself to me
Tonight, you came here
'Cause you know what I need
And no one likes to be alone
I don't need a future, I don't need your past
I just need a lover
So gimme what I want or I'll give it to my-
Self-inflicted torture, you don't have to ask
I just need a lover
So gimme what I want or I'll give it to myself
Give it to me, babe (give it to me, babe)
Give it to me, babe (give it to me, babe)
Give it to me and nobody else, babe
Give it to me, babe (give it to me, babe)
Give it to me, babe (give it to me, babe)
Give it to me and nobody else, babe
Gimme what I want (want, want, want)
Gimme what I want or I'll give it to myself
