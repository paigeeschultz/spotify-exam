Sometimes I get a little too hurt
Got my mind goin' places it ain't wanna go
Sometimes I get a little too low
And I can't see myself through the fire and smoke
And you, like a neon light
Shinin' through a door that I can't keep closed
And you, like a rollin' stone
Always buildin' cities on the hearts that you broke
And in my head, I did my very best saying goodbye, goodbye
And I don't miss you, but, I think of you and don't know why
I still feel high
I still feel high
Sometimes I stay up all night
'Cause you don't ever talk to me in my dreams
And I think about eventually you're holdin' me
And dancin' to the record like a movie scene
And in my head, I did my very best saying goodbye, goodbye
And I don't miss you, but, I think of you and don't know why
I still feel high
I still feel high
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Sometimes I get a little too hurt
Got my mind goin' places it ain't wanna go
And in my head, I did my very best saying goodbye, goodbye
And I don't miss you, but, I think of you and don't know why
I still feel high
I still feel high
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
I still feel high
