I woke up in Montecito
I was thinkin' about my life
And the questions made more questions
Starin' out into the night
Yes, I've worn the golden G-string
Put my hand into hellfire
I did it all to make you love me and to feel alive
Oh, that's just the world that we're livin' in
The old boys hold all the cards and they ain't playin' gin
You dare to call me crazy, have you looked around this place?
I should walk away
Oh, I should walk away
But I think I'll stay
There are layers to this body
Primal sex and primal shame
They told me I should cover it
So I went the other way
I was tryin' to own my power
Still I'm tryin' to work it out
And at least it gives the papers somethin' they can write about
And oh, that's just the world that we're livin' in
The old boys hold all the cards and they ain't playin' gin
And you dare to call me crazy, have you looked around this place?
I should walk away
Oh, I should walk away
But I think I'll stay
So the mad man's in the big chair
And his heart's an iron vault
He says, "If you can't make ends meet, honey, it must be your fault"
We all focus on the winners
And get blinded by their shine
Maybe caring for each other's just too 1969
But oh, that's just the world that we're livin' in
The old boys hold all the cards and they ain't playin' gin
And you dare to call me crazy, have you looked around this place?
I should walk away
Oh, I should walk away
But I think I'll stay
And I think I'll stay, yeah
I have too much to lose
So I think I'll stay
I can't walk away
