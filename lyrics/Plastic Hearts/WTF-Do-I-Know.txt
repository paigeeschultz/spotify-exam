I'm not tryna have another conversation
Probably not gon' wanna play me on your station
Pourin' out a bottle full of my frustration
Here to tell you somethin' that you don't know
I'm the type to drive a pickup through your mansion
I'm completely naked, but I'm makin' it fashion
Maybe gettin' married just to cause a distraction
Here to tell you somethin' that you don't know
Am I wrong that I moved on and I
And I don't even miss you?
Thought that it'd be you until I die
But I let go
What the fuck do I know? I'm alone
'Cause I couldn't be somebody's hero
You want an apology? Not from me
Had to leave you in your own misery
So tell me, baby, am I wrong that I moved on and I
And I don't even miss you?
Thought that it'd be you until I die
But I let go, what the fuck do I know? (Oh)
Tryna see the stars through the new pollution
Think that I'm the problem? Honey, I'm the solution
Maybe all the chaos is for your amusement
Here to tell you somethin' that you don't know
Put you on a pedestal, you're cravin' the spotlight
Desperate for attention, nose is bloody, it's daylight
Wakin' up with people that we met for the first time
Loved it, then I hated it, and I let you go
What the fuck do I know? I'm alone
'Cause I couldn't be somebody's hero
You want an apology? Not from me
Had to leave you in your own misery
So tell me, baby, am I wrong that I moved on and I
And I don't even miss you?
Thought that it'd be you until I die
But I let go, what the fuck do I know?
What?
What the fuck do I know? (Do I know) I'm alone (I'm alone)
'Cause I couldn't be somebody's hero
You want an apology? (Apology) not from me (not from me)
Had to leave you in your own misery
So tell me, baby, am I wrong that I moved on and I
And I don't even miss you?
Thought that it'd be you until I die
But I let go, what the fuck do I know?
