Sometimes I'm good for nothin'
Sometimes the best you've ever had
Sometimes I need your lovin'
Sometimes I stab you in the back
I found a meanin'
Just what I needed
Cut on the bathroom wall (uh)
Midnight reflection
Cravin' attention
Under the disco ball
Night crawlin', sky fallin'
Gotta listen when the devil's callin'
Can't shake it, I'll taste it
When it's yellin' out my name, I chase it
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Come on, come on, night crawlin'
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Come on, come on, night crawlin'
Sometimes my thoughts are violent (are violent)
Sometimes they bring me to the light
Sometimes I sit in silence (in silence)
Sometimes I'm running for my life
I found the meaning (I found the meaning)
Just what I needed (just what I needed)
Cut on the bathroom wall
In my reflection (in my reflection)
Cravin' attention
Under the disco ball, yeah, yeah
Night crawlin', sky fallin'
Gotta listen when the devil's callin' (oh, oh)
Can't shake it, I'll taste it
When it's yellin' out my name, I chase it
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Come on, come on, night crawlin'
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Come on, come on, night crawlin'
Come on
Night crawlin' (night crawlin'), sky fallin' (sky fallin')
Gotta listen when the devil's callin' (devil's callin')
Can't shake it (hey), I'll taste it (I'll taste)
When it's yellin' out my name, I chase it
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (oh, hey)
Come on, come on, night crawlin'
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Come on, come on, night crawlin'
Come on
