They say love can drive you crazy, my dear
Wanna trap you in a locket, or in my pocket
So I can keep you near
You know I'd never hurt you
If you fall, I’d pick you up and I'd drink your tears
But how can I miss you so much
When you're right here?

They say good things come to those who wait
It’s like countin' in light years
I'd physically live without you, but I don't want to
Death's never been my fear
You can take my blood, take my bones
My heart is yours, I volunteer (Ah)
But how can I miss you so much
When you're right here?

When you look up at a rainbow
Do you ever wonder what's really waiting at the end?
I don't want no gold, nothing’s more than you
The amount is hard to even comprehend
Nothing I can do, I lost control, somethin’ we hold on to so dear
And how can I miss you so much when you're right here?
