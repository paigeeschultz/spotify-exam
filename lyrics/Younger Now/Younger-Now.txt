Feels like I just woke up
Like all this time I've been asleep
Even though it's not who I am
I'm not afraid of who I used to be
No one stays the same (Oh, oh)
You know what goes up must come down (Oh, oh)
Change is a thing you can count on (Oh, oh)
I feel so much younger now (Oh, oh)
Feels like I've been living in a dream
But never make it to the end
My eyes open when they feel the light
It's always right before I'm about to scream
No one stays the same (Oh, oh)
You know what goes up must come down (Oh, oh)
Change is a thing you can count on (Oh, oh)
I feel so much younger now (Oh, oh)
What goes up must come down
What goes up must come down
What goes up must come down
What goes up must come down (yeah)
No one stays the same (Oh, oh)
You know what goes comes back around (Oh, oh)
Change is a thing you can count on (Oh, oh)
I feel so much younger now (Oh, oh)
I feel so much younger now (yeah)
I feel so much younger now
