You gotta love someone
I don't know what you've been told
Or what they say about me
I never give up, or give it a rest
I ain't got time to worry about a mess
And I'm kinda getting tired of dealing with all of your stress
I'm starting to think you have no heart, yeah
You don't even have a soul
You always give in or you try too late
All I do is give and all you do is take
I'm tired of protecting you from what you need to know
Ever since the day that I met you
I knew you weren't the one
But nothing ever stops me from forgetting
Packing all my shit and moving on
I'm not sure I'd even go
'Cause I made your house my home
It's come to an end
I hate how it's been
Lights are getting dim
And the walls are caving in
And it's time for this queen to go and run another throne
When I give it up, I give it all
I went and made you my life
And don't you dare say I don't care
When I need you most, you know you're never there
Be a cold day in hell before I'd ever be your wife (that's right)
Ever since the day that I met you
I knew you weren't the one
But nothing ever stops me from forgetting
Packing all my shit and moving on (hey, yeah)
Kicking off my shoes and running towards the sun
I said, "Nothing's really worth it 'less you're having fun"
To make somebody stay
You gotta love someone
You gotta love someone
Ever since the day that I met you
I knew you weren't the one
But nothing ever stops me from forgetting
Packing all my shit and moving on (hey, yeah)
You gotta love someone (hey, yeah)
You gotta love someone (hey, yeah)
You gotta love someone (hey, yeah)
You gotta love someone (hey, yeah)
