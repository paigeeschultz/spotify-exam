I'm writing down my dreams, all I'd like to see
Starting with the bees or else they're gonna die
There won't be no trees or air for us to breathe
I'll start feeling mad, but then I feel inspired
Thinking about the days coming home with dirty feet
From playing with my dad all day in the creek
He somehow has a way of knowing what to say
So when I'm feeling sad, he makes me feel inspired
We are meant for more
You're the handle on the door that opens up to change
I know that sounds so strange, to think
We are meant for more
Pull the handle on the door that opens up to change
I know that sounds so strange
'Cause you've always felt so small, but know you aren't at all
And I hope you feel inspired
Oh, I hope you feel inspired
How can we escape all the fear and all the hate?
Is anyone watching us down here?
Death is life, it's not a curse
Reminds us of time and what it's worth
To make the most out of it while we're here
We are meant for more
Pull the handle on the door that opens up to change
I know it sounds so strange
We are meant for more
There's a lock upon the door, but we hold the key to change
But how can we escape all the fear and all the hate?
Is anyone watching us down here?
