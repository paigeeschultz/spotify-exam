One, two, three, four
I don't know where you always go
Why you trying to keep it on the low?
I'm always like: Where the hell you been? Uh
You tell me that you've been hanging with your friends
Something seems just a little sus
We ain't got nothing if there ain't no trust
I'm not sure, but I got a hunch, uh
And now you got me thinking way too much
I've been thinkin' way too much, much, much, much
You ain't been calling me enough, 'nough, 'nough, 'nough
Now I'm longing for your touch, touch, touch, touch
I've been thinking way too much
I've been thinking way too much
You won't pick up the phone, phone, phone, phone
Now I'm sitting here alone, lone, lone, lone
Do you do this just for fun, fun, fun, fun?
I've been thinking way too much
I've been thinking way too much
Oh yeah, all I do is think about you
Oh yeah, all I do is think about you
Oh yeah, all I do is think about you
Oh yeah, all I do is think about you
It's getting late, I'm starting to obsess
You got me crying and looking like a mess
My daddy said: Stay away from such, uh
But now you got me thinking way too much
I've been thinking if way too much, much, much, much
You ain't been calling me enough, 'nough, 'nough, 'nough
Now I'm longing for your touch, touch, touch, touch
I've been thinking way too much
I've been thinking way too much
You won't pick up the phone, phone, phone, phone
Now I'm sitting here alone, lone, lone, lone
Do you do this just for fun, fun, fun, fun?
I've been thinking way too much
I've been thinking way too much
Oh yeah, all I do is think about you
Oh yeah, all I do is think about you
Oh yeah, all I do is think about you
Oh yeah, all I do is think about you
All night, all I do is think about you
All night, all I do is think about you
All night, all I do is think about you
All night, all I do is think about you
All night, all I do is think about you
All night, all I do is think about you
All night, all I do is think about you
All night, all I do is think about you
I've been thinking if way too much, much, much, much
You ain't been calling me enough, 'nough, 'nough, 'nough
Now I'm longing for your touch, touch, touch, touch
I've been thinking way too much
I've been thinking way too much
You won't pick up the phone, phone, phone, phone
Now I'm sitting here alone, lone, lone, lone
Do you do this just for fun, fun, fun, fun?
I've been thinking way too much
I've been thinking way too much
Oh yeah, all I do is think about you
Oh yeah, all I do is think about you
Oh yeah, all I do is think about you
Oh yeah, all I do is think about you
