Don't keep me waiting and anticipating
Treating me like a fool
I got news for you
I'm turning my back
I'm dropping a bomb on you, ah, ah
You want me, you need me
Believe me, you'll be crawling
You love me, you hate me
Believe me, you'll come crawling
So get down and get off
Let me show you what you'll be missing
We break up, you break down
Gonna drag you through this kicking and screaming
Don't get me guessing
I'm your favourite obsession
Don't give me a lame excuse
It's with me that you're missing
It's the same old confession
You're no one that something would lose, ah, ah
Watch out now
Don't black out
There's no doubt
You can't have it
Control you, I'll own you
I'll show you, but you still can't have it
So get down and get off
Let me show you what you'll be missing
We break up, you break down
Gonna drag you through this kicking and screaming
So get down and get it off
You're not the only one that I've been missing
We break up, you break down
Gonna drag you through this kicking and screaming
You'll be kicking and screaming
You'll be kicking and screaming
I'm so deceiving
You'll be kicking and screaming, ah
Watch out now, you'll find out, you'll find out
There's no one above me
I play hard to run far
Come back now
I really do like you
So get down and get off
I'ma show you what you'll be missing
We break up, you break down
Gonna drag you through this kicking and screaming
So get down and get off
You're not the only one that I've been missing
We break up, you break down
Gonna drag you through this kicking and screaming
You'll be kicking and screaming
You'll be kicking and screaming
Kicking and screaming
Kicking and screaming
