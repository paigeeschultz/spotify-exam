Seems like we're holding on forever
I gotta let it go
And time's up, you pushed me to surrender tonight
Who knows what's happens now, whatever
Wherever the wind blows
And I'm there as long as we're together
Alright
Let's have the time of our lives
Like there's no one else around
Just throw your hands up high
Even when they try to take us down
We'll have the time of our lives
'Til the lights burn out
Let's laugh until we cry
Life is only what you make it now
Let's have the time of our lives
Dreamers don't care if its right
I think I'm really into you
Restless, lets leave it all behind tonight
Crazy when you cross my mind
Oh, the trouble we could get into
So what? Let's just give this a try
Alright
Let's have the time of our lives
Like there's no one else around
Just throw your hands up high
Even when they try to take us down
We'll have the time of our lives
'Til the lights burn out
Let's laugh until we cry
Life is only what you make it now
Let's have the time of our lives
Looking back, what are we waiting for?
Take the chance, now's all we got for sure
Let's have the time of our lives
Like there's no one else around
Just throw your hands up high
Even when they try to take us down
We'll have the time of our lives
'Til the lights burn out
Let's laugh until we cry
Life is only what you make it now
Let's have the time of our lives
